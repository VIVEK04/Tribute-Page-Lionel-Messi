            <h1>* INTRODUCTION </h1>
            <p>
                Lionel Andrés "Leo" Messi (born 24 June 1987) is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a forward for and captains both Major League Soccer club Inter Miami and the Argentina national team. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Messi has won a record eight Ballon d'Or awards, a record six European Golden Shoes, and was named the world's best player for a record eight times by FIFA.Until 2021, he had spent his entire professional career with Barcelona, where he won a club-record 34 trophies, including ten La Liga titles, seven Copa del Rey titles, and the UEFA Champions League four times.[note 3] With his country, he won the 2021 Copa América and the 2022 FIFA World Cup. A prolific goalscorer and creative playmaker, Messi holds the records for most goals (474), hat-tricks (36), and assists in La Liga (192). He has the most international goals by a South American male (106). Messi has scored over 800 senior career goals for club and country, and the most goals for a single club (672).<br><br>

                Messi relocated to Spain and joined Barcelona aged 13, making his competitive debut at age 17 in October 2004. He established himself as an integral player for the club within the next three years, and in his first uninterrupted season in 2008–09 helped Barcelona achieve the first treble in Spanish football; that year, aged 22, Messi won his first Ballon d'Or.<br><br>
                
                Messi has endorsed sportswear company Adidas since 2006. According to France Football, he was the world's highest-paid footballer for five years out of six between 2009 and 2014, and was ranked the world's highest-paid athlete by Forbes in 2019 and 2022. Messi was among Time's 100 most influential people in the world in 2011, 2012, and 2023.

                <h1>* EARLY LIFE AND STRUGGLES</h1>
                <p>
                    His father, Jorge Messi, worked in a steel factory, and his mother, Celia Cuccittini, was a part-time cleaner. Messi showed an exceptional talent for football from a very young age, often playing with his older brothers and cousins. By the time he was five, he had joined the local club Grandoli, where his father coached him.<BR><BR>
                    
                    However, Messi's early years were not without struggles. At the age of 10, he was diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency, a condition that stunted his growth. The treatment required expensive daily injections of human growth hormone, which his family could not afford. Messi's potential as a footballer was evident, but his physical development lagged behind his peers, making it challenging for him to compete at the highest levels.<BR><BR>
                        
                    In 2000, when Messi was 13, FC Barcelona offered him a chance to join their famed La Masia academy. Recognizing his immense talent, the club agreed to cover the costs of his medical treatment. This was a pivotal moment in Messi's life. Moving to Spain was a significant adjustment; he had to leave his family and friends behind in Argentina. The cultural and linguistic differences were daunting for the young Messi, who was shy and introverted.<BR><BR>
                        
                    Despite these challenges, Messi thrived in Barcelona's youth system. His extraordinary skills and determination quickly set him apart. He progressed through the ranks, dazzling coaches and teammates with his ability. By the age of 17, he made his first-team debut for Barcelona, marking the beginning of an illustrious career.<BR><BR>
                        
                    Messi's early life and struggles shaped his character, instilling in him a resilience and work ethic that propelled him to overcome obstacles and become one of the greatest footballers of all time. His journey from a small-town boy in Argentina to a global football icon is a testament to his perseverance and talent.

                    <h1> * CAREER </h1>
                    <p>
                        Lionel Messi, widely regarded as one of the greatest footballers of all time, has had an illustrious career marked by numerous records and accolades. Born on June 24, 1987, in Rosario, Argentina, Messi joined FC Barcelona's famed La Masia academy at 13. He made his first-team debut in 2004 at just 17 years old. Over the next 17 years, Messi became the club's all-time top scorer and led Barcelona to numerous titles, including 10 La Liga championships and four UEFA Champions League trophies.<br><br>

                        Messi's individual achievements are equally remarkable. He has won the Ballon d'Or, awarded to the world's best player, a record seven times. Known for his incredible dribbling, vision, and goal-scoring ability, Messi has consistently delivered breathtaking performances.<br><br>
                        
                        In 2021, Messi's storied tenure at Barcelona ended due to financial constraints at the club, leading to his move to Paris Saint-Germain (PSG). Despite this transition, he continued to excel, winning Ligue 1 and further cementing his legacy.<br><br>
                        
                        Internationally, Messi overcame criticism for his national team performances by leading Argentina to victory in the 2021 Copa América and the 2022 FIFA World Cup, achieving his long-awaited dream of international glory. His career, characterized by skill, dedication, and an insatiable drive to succeed, remains a testament to his extraordinary talent and enduring influence on the sport.
